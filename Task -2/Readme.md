## Problem 1: Unique Words in a Sentence

### Problem Statement
Given a sentence, identify all unique words and display:

* The total count of unique words
* The unique words themselves

### Hint
* Split the sentence into individual words
* Convert the list into a set to remove duplicates
* Display the set and its length

### Example Input
```
Enter sentence: python is easy and python is powerful
```

### Expected Output
```
Unique words count: 5
Unique words: {'python', 'is', 'easy', 'and', 'powerful'}
```

## Problem 2: Highest Salary from Employee Data

### Problem Statement
Store employee names and their salaries, then determine which employee has the highest salary.

### Hint
* Use a dictionary to store employee names and salaries
* Compare salary values to find the highest

### Example Input
```python
employees = {
    "Ravi": 75000,
    "Anita": 68000,
    "Kiran": 72000
}
```

### Expected Output
```
Highest Salary: Ravi - 75000
```

## Problem 3: Find Maximum and Minimum Values

### Problem Statement
Find the maximum and minimum values from a list of numbers.

### Hint
* Initialize max and min using the first element
* Use a loop to compare remaining elements

### Example Input
```python
numbers = [45, 22, 89, 10, 66]
```

### Expected Output
```
List: [45, 22, 89, 10, 66]
Max: 89
Min: 10
```

### Real‑World Applications

## Problem 4: Count Products Above a Price Threshold

### Problem Statement
Count how many products have a price greater than 1000.

### Hint
* Use a loop
* Compare each price with 1000

### Example Input
```python
prices = [450, 1200, 899, 1500, 300]
```

### Expected Output
```
Products above 1000: 2
```

### Real‑World Applications
* E‑commerce filtering
* Budget analysis
* Product categorization

## Problem 5: Calculate Attendance Percentage

### Problem Statement
Calculate attendance percentage from a list containing "P" and "A".

### Hint
* Count total "P"
* Divide by total number of days

### Example Input
```python
attendance = ["P", "P", "A", "P", "P"]
```

### Expected Output
```
Attendance Percentage: 80.0
```

### Real‑World Applications
* Student attendance systems
* HR attendance tracking

---

## Problem 6: Remove Duplicate Phone Numbers

### Problem Statement
Remove duplicate phone numbers and display only unique numbers.

### Hint
* Convert list to set

### Example Input
```python
phone_numbers = [9876543210, 9123456789, 9876543210]
```

### Expected Output
```
Unique phone numbers: {9876543210, 9123456789}
```

### Real‑World Applications
* Contact management systems
* CRM databases

---

## Problem 7: Count Character Frequency

### Problem Statement
Count how many times each character appears in a string.

### Hint
* Use a dictionary
* Increase count for each occurrence

### Expected Output
```
{'p': 2, 'y': 1, 't': 1, 'h': 1, 'o': 1, 'n': 1}
```

### Real‑World Applications
* Text analysis
* Password validation

---

## Problem 8: Convert List to Tuple

### Problem Statement
Convert a list into a tuple.

### Hint
* Use tuple() function

### Expected Output
```
Tuple: (10, 20, 30)
```

### Real‑World Applications
* Read‑only data storage
* Configuration systems

---

## Problem 9: Check if a Key Exists in a Dictionary

### Problem Statement
Check whether a specific key exists in a dictionary.

### Hint
* Use the "in" keyword

### Expected Output
```
Employee exists
```

### Real‑World Applications
* User validation
* System configuration checks

---

## Problem 10: Calculate Average Marks

### Problem Statement
Calculate the average marks from a list.
